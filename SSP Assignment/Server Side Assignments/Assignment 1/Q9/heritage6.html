                    <p>
                        Lalbagh Palace was built by the Holkar Dynasty, and is situated in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India.

The Holkar family resided in the palace up to 1978. After the death of Tukojirao Holkar(III), his granddaughter Usha Raje established a trust and looked after the estate. Later, the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Arjun Singh brought it under control of State Government.
