                        The Krishnapura Chhatris, also known as the Krishna Pura Chhatris are three chhatris located in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India.[1] The structures were built by the Holkars as cenotaphs over the spots where people of importance were cremated, leading to them also being known as the Holkar Chhatris. All three of the Chhatris are located half a kilometer from the city palace, Rajwada, which was also built by the Holkar dynasty.
